            Our application is aimed at helping Canadian youth discover, research and choose future career paths. It allows them to search by various professions and view visualizations of projected employment statistics and job prospects for the chosen field, based on data from Employment and Social Development Canada. It also ties these job titles to actual opportunities that are updated real-time by GlassDoor.
